2. install node at a global level
3. open cmd prompt or terminal in the unzipped 'Datepicker' folder and type 'npm install'
4. after installing of node module(s), type 'npm run server'
5. as it says, the app is up at '3030' port number(it's hardcoded for now temporarily)
6. fire up the browser(which should have been an automatic task!) and point to 'localhost:3030/'
